MLOPS Pipeline
1) Data Engineer(data-> API, DB -> API )
2) Collaboration(model-> different models that developers use)
3) Code(developers-> backend frontend)

Data Engineering

Collaboration:
  pre processing
  feature engineering
  model training
  evaluation

Code:
  Backend, backend is then connected to DB eg Node
  Frontend eg html

MLOPS:
  deploy model in production? stream that data and then keep on updating it
  This whole pipeline is MLOP pipeline
